The original europarl files contain blank lines.
TODO: See if they line up in en vs fr.
Maybe that's why the merged versions don't have the same number of
lines; they don't have blank lines in them, I believe.

I've written a remove_blanklines.d .need to test and add to run.sh

europarl page has a tools.tgz.  More complete version of the ones from
wmt12.  Use those; more prefix files if nothing else. Also probably
where wmt12 got it from, so better to cite that.
