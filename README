Preprocesses WMT12 en-fr parallel corpora, and uses the raw data to locate
document boundaries, which are then marked with </doc> tags.


Scripts included from other projects:

pre-tokenizer.perl : from Moses
tokenizer.perl : from europarl tools.tgz
normalize-punctuation.perl : from wmt12 tools


fetch.sh will grab the corpora from the internet and extract the necessary files
to various subdirectories under ./corpora.

./run.sh can then be run immediately.

Alternately, you can download/extract them yourself and set the variables in run.sh
appropriately.


These scripts don't do OOV replacement or recasing; that can be done by the
model if desired.
